# Python SDK Example

This repo contains a python file that contains a few sample events(custom, commerce, and sessions). You can see more methods here [here](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/server/python/)

# Preqs

You will need ```pip``` to run the install. You can see more information on how to install pip  [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

If you are finding ```pip install mparticle ``` is not working try ```python -m pip install mparticle ``` instead

git-clone the repo and cd inside the directory. Then do the following. 

1. pip install mparticle
2. python python_test_server.py
3. Check console for print messages. Check Livestream to confirm event arrival.
